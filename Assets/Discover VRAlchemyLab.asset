  Title: VR Alchemy Lab
  Image: {fileID: 0}
  Description: 'The Alchemy Lab is a little VR demo to introduce HDRP VR.

    

    This
    document explains how the assets of the demo have been built. Different approaches
    have been used to produce them with the challenge to minimize the cost (CPU,
    GPU, memory).

    

    Some assets are built by photogrammetry and when no
    subject has been found, they are done by a Zbrush sculpting.
